        I'm an explorer at heart, constantly seeking new challengesâ€”whether in
        life or in code. I find joy in learning, experimenting, and building
        things that push the boundaries of creativity and logic.

        As a backend-focused full-stack developer, I thrive on solving complex
        problems and optimizing systems for efficiency. My fascination with
        software began in school, and since then, computers have been an
        inseparable part of my journey.

        Beyond just writing code, I enjoy understanding the "why" behind
        problems, breaking them down, and crafting elegant, scalable solutions.
        When I step away from my screen, I find peace in jogging with music on,
        letting my mind wander as I recharge for the next challenge.
